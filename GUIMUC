//Lab 10: Lab 10: More Java GUI: Measurement Unit Convertor (Group Work)
//The following is a “Measurement Unit Convertor” application which can convert a numeric value from pound (lb) to kilogram (kg).
//It also captures any exceptional situation (such as entering a String “abc” in the pound textField, etc.) 
//using the exception handling concepts covered in previous lectures. 
//Note: By looking at the graphical sample provided we can deduce that the necessary layouts required for this 
//project's desired look are flowlayout and grid layout
//for simplicity sake we will be using flowlayout as it operates on the basis of having entries start from left to right
